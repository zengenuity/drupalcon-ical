# DrupalCon Session iCal Exporter

The DrupalCon website lets you add sessions to "My Schedule", but unfortunately it doesn't allow you to export those to your own calendar with iCal, so I wrote a Greasemonkey script that lets you export .ics files for sessions and BoFs. Unfortunately, you still have to do them one at a time, but it's much faster than typing them in.

There are currently scripts for DrupalCon 2015 and 2016 websites. Choose the correct file, and copy the user script into GreaseMonkey to enable. The scripts have been written to make all the events show up in the correct time zone of the conferences.

Once you add the script to GreaseMonkey, an [iCal] link will show up on session pages right next to the date and time of the session. Click the link to add the session to your calendar.
